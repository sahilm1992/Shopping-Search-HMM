ii. Name: Sahil Manchanda
iii. Assignment: DIGIT RECOGNITION HMM.
iv. Visual Studio version: VS 2013

v. Steps to execute code:

a) Open .Sln file in VS 2013
b) Build and Run	
c) Console will display the following:
	1.Calculation of Cis
	2.Calcualtion of Universe, Codebook using LBG
	3.Calculation of observation sequence
	4.Training of HMM Models
	5.Testing of audio samples
	6.Result of testing


Outputs are stored in :
1.Cis : Outputs/Cis
2.Observation Sequences : //Output/obs
3.HMM models of A, B and pi for each digit : //Output/Hmmoutputs
4. Universe, codebook in //Output// Folder
5.Result in //Output//finalresults.txt 
for each recording sample , the detected digit is displayed
